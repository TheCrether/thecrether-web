This post is about my fourth year of my Programming class (POS). The image above is from JAXB_OpenWeatherMap, a project which fetches XML data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it.

[Github repo][1] -> This repo is offline because people from my school were copying my projects and handing them in.

## Why

This is for managing my source code when coding our tasks and also so that I can share the code between my Laptop & PC or Windows & Linux on the same system.

## How

The projects show what I learned during the year.

The different grades/years are split up into multiple branches, so I do not have to manage multiple repositories.

## Content

This year we focused on web applications.

### Web Apps

We started off with an introduction to web applications with Java Servlets. After that, we learned about using [JSPs][2] and the [JSTL][3] core library to make dynamic pages way easier than the manual way.

The main topics we covered were:

- using cookies to save language selections
- Java Servlets
- JSPs (Java/Jakarta Server Pages) + JSTL Core
- using [lombok][4] for less manual Java code for data classes
- parsing/creating JSON manually and with [Jackson][5]
- parsing/creating XML data manually and with [JAXB][6]

## Conclusion

I probably spent way too much time on the different projects, but I just love CSS for designing websites and always want them to look as good as possible. This applies especially when I have a lot of ideas.
