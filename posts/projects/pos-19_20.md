# POS

This repo is basically all my projects that I did with Java in my Programming class (POS), while in school.<br />
[Github Repo][1]

## Why

I needed a good way of managing my growing source code when doing the tasks from school.<br />
The other part, which I found very pleasant, was that I could now share my code more easily between my laptop and PC.

## How

All the projects you see are basically what I learnt during the year.

The specific years are listed in the different branches so I don't have to manage multiple repositories.

## What is the content

At the time of writing this, I am in the third school year.

In this year we did a lot of work regarding multiple important aspects of programming with Java.

### Android

[Link to Folder][2]
In the first semester, we did a lot with Android.
We learned how to make a Android apps with a lot of the different building blocks that are available out of the box.<br/>
The main topics we covered were:

- Basic layouting (`LinearLayout`) and modifying data
- More complex layouts (`RelativeLayout`)
- the use of lists through the `RecyclerView`
- how to move between Activities with the use of `Intent`s

### Threads

During the transition from the first semester to the second semester, we had some periods with Threads in Java.
We also solved some [ProjectEuler][3] problems with Threads.<br/>
Here the main aspects were:

- how to create threads
- how to manage them in a `ExecutorService` & `ExecutorCompletionService`
- how to "synchronize" them with the `synchronized` block

### JDBC

After using Threads, we switched to using JDBC with PostgreSQL. We did not use any framework like Hibernate.
We had some fun projects here like managing a database of employees<br />
What we did:

- How to connect to the database and use the right database driver
- how to build a good structure for accesing the database
- the use of `PreparedStatement`s
- I also splitted the SQL statements for the `PreparedStatement`s into seperate files and had a structured way of loading them

## Conclusion

This year's programming tasks were fun most of the time, but I still like languages like TypeScript or Golang more than Java.
