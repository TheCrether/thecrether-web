TermFTP is primarily a FTP client with a full SSH client included. We started it as a school project for our project management class. Since you might wonder who "we" is, the project team consists of [@0Adiber][1], [@eliaswil][2] and [@3keeksi][3] and myself.

The application is split up into frontend and backend. [@0Adiber][1] and me created the [client][4] itself, and [@eliaswil][2] and [@3keeksi][3] developed the [API][5] for it.

The main reason we came up with this idea because we do not like the design of current FTP clients. Of course, we also wanted to stand out, which is why we included a SSH client out of the box.

## Project Management

We are required to use the [SCRUM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) framework for project management, since this project was done for our project management class.
